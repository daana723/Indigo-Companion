# Design Document

## Overview

The ADHD AI Companion is a web-based application that provides personalized support for neurodivergent users through adaptive assessments, tailored recommendations, positive affirmations, and wellness practices. The system uses a conversational interface with intelligent questioning to understand user needs and deliver appropriate support interventions.

## Architecture

The application follows a modular, client-side architecture optimized for accessibility and neurodivergent user needs:

```
